# YOLOR_custom_data2

Here used torch version==1.7  and python 3.7
use process.py file to convert path text file
But you can also use method in https://www.ai4prod.ai/create-custom-yolo-dataset/ link too.

Also remember to add 2 data files because of path different in system fle. But you can overcome it by put in main directory
